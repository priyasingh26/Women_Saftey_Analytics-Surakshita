## Project Overview
**Women Safety Analytics** is a real-time threat detection platform aimed at enhancing the safety of women in public spaces. This platform leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **IoT** technologies to monitor, detect, and alert users about potential threats. Additionally, it empowers communities to report unsafe areas and assists law enforcement in responding to incidents more quickly.

## Features
- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: AI-driven detection of suspicious activities in public spaces.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Immediate alerts to law enforcement, guardians, and nearby users.
- **Gesture-Based Emergency Triggers**: Allows users to send an SOS alert with predefined gestures.
- **GPS Tracking**: Real-time location sharing and guidance to the nearest safe areas.
- **Community Reporting**: User-driven reports on unsafe locations for proactive safety.
- **Predictive Crime Analytics**: Analysis of past incidents to predict potential crime hotspots.
  
## Android App Features
- **Panic Alarm Activation**: Notify contacts and nearby users instantly during emergencies.
- **Safety Tips & Resources**: Provides safety suggestions and directions to nearby safe areas.
  
## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Mobile App**: Android (Java/Kotlin)
- **Machine Learning**: AI models for anomaly detection and behavioral analysis
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Services**: AWS/Google Cloud (for real-time data processing and storage)
